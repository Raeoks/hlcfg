Introduction

When a player presses a key in Half-life and something happens, it is because that key has been "bound" to a command. For example, the up arrow key is bound to the move forward command.

Every command in Half-life can also be directly executed from the console. The console is a text interface to Half-life which is only available if the hl.exe program is started with the argument "-console". Normally, pressing the "`" key (top left of the keyboard, to the left of the "1" key) displays the console on screen.
Half-life also supports aliases. An alias is a name which when typed in the console, executes a whole series of commands, one after the other. Players use the alias command to tell Half-life which commands to execute for a given alias name. Usefully, aliases can be bound to a key so a whole series of commands - such as buy gun, buy ammo, buy armour - can be made to happen at the press of one key.

Finally, Half-life can also execute scripts - text files on disk which are lists of commands - using the exec command. Typically, players store their aliases in a text file or two, execute those text files so Half-life loads the aliases, and then have keys bound to execute those aliases in-game. This is how buy scripts work.

alias (alias name) (command) 

The commands listed in command are executed when the alias name is executed in the console or via the bind command. 

e.g.

alias (name) "cmd1; cmd2" 

bind (key) (command or alias name) 

When the given key is pressed, the command or the alias specified is executed. 

e.g.

bind "(key)" "(command)" 

or

bind Z "+reload" 

Now the key Z is bound to the reload command. So if I press Z you will reload.

*Note* All your binds are saved in a file called the config.cfg. This file automatically rebinds the numbers 0-9 to the slots, so if you binded them earlier, expect the game to rebind them to the slots 0-9.


echo (string) 

The string is printed in the console. 

exec (filename) 

The filename is assumed to be a half-life script and is executed. 

for example you can store all your binds in a file called binds.cfg and can call it by typing exec binds.cfg and HL will load all the bindings in that config file

unbind (key) 

The command bound to the key with the bind command is removed and so no longer occurs when the key is pressed. This command is the opposite of the bind command. 

unbindall 

All commands bound to all keys are removed. 

Autoexec.cfg

The autoexec.cfg file is a file that is executed during the loading of the game. It usually follows the config.cfg file. The Autoexec is user created and is NOT generated by the game. To make a autoexec, simply open up Notepad in WIN95/98/ETC and save the file as autoexec.cfg in your cstrike directory. This file will contain your aliases and game related info other than binds. 

Config.cfg

This is a file generated by Half-Life and is located in your cstrike directory. It saves the game information from the last time you quit the game. The file contains all of the Half-Life game settings and configurations you chose within the game. You can edit this file in Notepad or within the game using the console. Here is an example of a standard config.cfg file, note the bind for "Z" is "cover" from the above alias and bind examples.

Other .cfg files

You can also create other .cfg files and have them executed by adding: exec XXXX.cfg to your autoexec.cfg file. For example, if I have numerous buy commands and putting them all into the autoexec will get too cluttered; I can make a buy.cfg file and put all my buy aliases in there. I would then just add the line: exec buy.cfg in my autoexec.cfg file.

Some Commond Used Bind Scripts

Following is collection of some of the most common and popular scripts used around the net

Nameswap Alias

This alias changes your name between two names with a single keystroke. Just plug your names in instead of the examples. Also, note that if you want spaces in your name, replace the space with a % sign, 
like: name N%e%w%b%i%e.

alias nameswap "name1" 
alias name1 "name KillerX; alias nameswap name2"
alias name2 "name [XTC]KillerX; alias nameswap name1" 

bind "x" "nameswap"


Note: Instead of using % sign you can also do another thing, type within " e.g. name "Hello World" will give you the same result, my personal experience says that this method is far less frustrating and easy than typing % after every word - baqai
